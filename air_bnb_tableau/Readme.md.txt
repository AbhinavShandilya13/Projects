# Airbnb Listings 2016 Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing Airbnb listing data from 2016 using Tableau to create visualizations for insights on pricing, listings, and revenue patterns.

## Dataset

- The dataset used is the **Airbnb Listings 2016 Dataset**, which was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/).
- It contains information about various Airbnb listings, including prices, zip codes, and bedroom counts.

## Visualizations

The analysis includes the following visualizations:

1. **Average Price per Bedroom** - A bar chart showcasing the average price for each bedroom count.
2. **Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings** - A breakdown of the number of listings per bedroom count.
3. **Price Per Zip code** - A map and bar chart comparing average prices by zip codes in the region.
4. **Revenue for the Year** - A line chart showing the revenue trends throughout the year 2016.

## Tools

- **Tableau**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Kaggle**: For sourcing the dataset.

## STAR Analysis

Here's a STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) analysis of this project:

- **Situation**: I wanted to gain insights from real-world data, particularly the **Airbnb Listings 2016 Dataset** from Kaggle, to understand pricing trends, bedroom listings, and revenue distribution across zip codes. The goal was to analyze the data effectively and create visualizations that could help interpret the data for decision-making.
- **Task**: I needed to build interactive visualizations that summarize and present key information like average prices per bedroom, revenue trends over the year, and geographical price distribution based on zip codes. The challenge was to extract meaningful insights from a large dataset and display them in an accessible way for others.
- **Action**:
    - I imported the Airbnb Listings dataset into **Tableau**.
    - I cleaned and transformed the data to remove any irrelevant or incomplete records.
    - I created various visualizations, including:
        - **Bar chart** for average price per bedroom.
        - **Map visualization** for prices by zip codes.
        - **Line chart** to show revenue trends over the course of the year.
        - **Distinct count** of bedroom listings to highlight supply in the market.
    - I combined these elements into an interactive Tableau dashboard, ensuring each visualization was clear, relevant, and offered insights at a glance.
- **Result**: The project resulted in an interactive Tableau dashboard that allowed users to:
    - Quickly understand how Airbnb prices varied by the number of bedrooms.
    - Identify which zip codes had the highest average prices and highest density of listings.
    - Track revenue changes over time, helping stakeholders make more informed decisions on listing prices and revenue forecasts.
    - This project also improved my Tableau skills and enhanced my portfolio with a real-world data analysis project.

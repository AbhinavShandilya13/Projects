# Bike Shop Analysis

This project involves analyzing sales, revenue, and rider demographics for a Bike Shop using Power BI. The report provides insights into when the shop is making the most profit and visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) over time.

## Dataset

- The dataset contains information about the Bike Shop’s sales, revenue, profit, and rider demographics for the year 2021.

## Visualizations

The Power BI report includes the following:

1. **Revenue and Profit Summary** - Displays total revenue ($5M) and profit ($3.42M) for the year.
2. **KPI Over Time** - A line and bar chart showing the average of profit, revenue, and the number of riders per month.
3. **Hourly Sales Table** - A detailed table that displays hourly sales data across a week.
4. **Revenue by Season** - A bar chart showing revenue per season.
5. **Rider Demographics** - A donut chart that visualizes the ratio between registered (80.11%) and casual (19.89%) riders.

## Tools

- **Power BI**: For data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation.

## STAR Analysis

Here's a STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) analysis of this project:

- **Situation**: I aimed to analyze the Bike Shop’s performance, focusing on sales patterns, revenue, and customer demographics, to identify when the shop makes the most money and provide insights for decision-making.
- **Task**: My objective was to design an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore the data, track KPIs, and visualize the sales and revenue trends over time and by season. I also aimed to identify key demographics of the riders.
- **Action**:
    - I imported the dataset into Power BI and cleaned it to ensure all data points were accurate.
    - I created a variety of visualizations, including bar charts, line charts, and a donut chart.
    - I focused on providing clear insights such as profit margins, revenue trends over time, and rider demographics.
- **Result**: The final Power BI report offers:
    - A clear understanding of when the Bike Shop is most profitable (monthly and seasonally).
    - Key insights into rider demographics, helping the shop understand its customer base.
    - Hourly sales patterns, providing actionable data for optimizing staffing and promotions.
    - This project improved my Power BI skills and contributed a strong project to my portfolio.
